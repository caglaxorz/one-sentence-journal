## 📝 APP DESCRIPTION (4000 character max)

**Character Count: 1,847 / 4000**

```
One Sentence Journal transforms the overwhelming task of journaling into a daily moment of clarity. Instead of staring at a blank page wondering what to write, you simply capture your day in one powerful sentence.

SIMPLICITY MEETS INSIGHT
Journaling shouldn't feel like homework. One Sentence Journal removes the pressure of writing lengthy entries while maintaining the profound benefits of daily reflection. Each day, write just one sentence—that's it. The constraint is the feature: it forces you to distill your day down to what truly mattered.

TRACK YOUR EMOTIONAL PATTERNS
Select from 12 mood emojis to capture how you felt each day. Over time, you'll discover patterns in your emotional landscape. Were you more peaceful on weekends? Did stressful Mondays turn into productive Tuesdays? Your journal becomes a map of your inner world.

KEY FEATURES
• Write one sentence per day with a simple, distraction-free interface
• 12 mood emojis: Grateful, Happy, Peaceful, Excited, Loved, Energized, Sad, Anxious, Angry, Tired, Sick, and Confused
• Beautiful calendar view showing your emotional journey at a glance
• Streak tracking to build a consistent journaling habit
• "Mattered" star to mark entries that hold special significance
• List view with powerful filtering by mood, date, and importance
• Search your entire journal to rediscover forgotten moments
• Dark mode for comfortable evening reflection
• Export your entire journal as a beautifully formatted PDF
• 100% private: your entries are encrypted and stored securely in Firebase
• Offline support: write anytime, sync when connected
• Email verification for account security
• Fully accessible with VoiceOver support

YOUR PRIVACY, GUARANTEED
Your journal is completely private. Entries are encrypted end-to-end and stored securely in your personal Firebase account. No one—not even us—can read your thoughts. You own your data, and you can export or delete it anytime.

BUILD A LIFE-CHANGING HABIT
Consistency is the key to journaling's benefits. Our streak counter keeps you motivated, and the low barrier of "just one sentence" makes it easy to maintain even on your busiest days. Miss a day? You can backdate entries to preserve your streak.

PERFECT FOR
• People who want to journal but find traditional journaling overwhelming
• Those seeking to understand their emotional patterns
• Anyone building a mindfulness or gratitude practice
• Busy professionals who want reflection without time commitment
• Students tracking their academic and personal growth
• Anyone on a mental wellness journey

Start capturing your life, one sentence at a time.
